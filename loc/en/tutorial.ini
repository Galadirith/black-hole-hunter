title-1=Welcome to Black Hole Hunter
text-1=Your objective is to listen to the signal below, and then determine which
  of the four data files contains the signal you heard. To begin with, the
  signals will be relatively loud. As you progress through the game the signals
  will get quieter.
title-2=Listen to the signal
text-2=Click on the signal below and press play to hear it. This is what the
  gravitational wave would sound like if there was no interference.
title-3=Listen to the data
text-3=Click on each of the data files below and press play to hear them. These
  files contain gravitational wave detector data. The detectors are not perfect
  and so the data files contain noise. One of these files contains the signal
  buried in the noise. Your objective is to find this data file.
title-4=Make your choice
text-4=If you think you have found the data file that contains the signal, press
  the green tick in the bottom right corner of the window. If you find the
  correct signal you can move on to the next level, if not you will lose a
  life. You start with 3 lives.

text=Now we will make things more challenging. Real interferometer data contains
  “glitches”. These are short loud sounds in the data that can be confused for a
  gravitational wave signal if you are not careful.

text=As the signals get quieter, and the glitches louder, it will become more
  and more difficult for you to detect the gravitational waves. To help you in
  your task, we have provided power ups. You can only use them once, but they
  will be replenished at certain points throughout the game. Hold the cursor
  over them to see what they do.

text=Things are about to get tough. To help you, let’s replenish your power ups.
