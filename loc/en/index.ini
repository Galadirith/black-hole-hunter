[about]

title = About
text = Using Einstein's General theory of Relativity, scientists predicted that
  when black holes collide, they produce gravitational waves traveling at the
  speed of light in all directions. When these gravitational waves reach the
  Earth, they produce minute vibrations which can be detected by the LIGO
  gravitational wave detector. The vibrations in the detector can be turned into
  a sound, allowing you to hear black hole collisions. However, other things can
  produce vibrations in the detector, such as an earthquake on the other side of
  the world or traffic a few miles away. This creates noise in the detectors
  which makes it harder to hear the gravitational wave signal. In Black Hole
  Hunter, your objective is to listen to gravitational wave detector data and
  determine whether or not you can hear the given gravitational wave signal in
  the sound file, or whether it is just noise. So click <b>Play Now</b>, and
  hear the sound track of the universe ...
