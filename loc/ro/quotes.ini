quote = Gaurile negre nu sunt chiar negre, ele emit unde gravitationale.
weblink = http://www.astro.cf.ac.uk/research/gravity/tutorial/?page=1blackholes

[quote2]

quote = Gaurile negre sunt caracterizate de doar doua unitati, masa si spin. Acest aspect le aseamana mult cu particulele elementare precum electronii si protonii.

[quote3]

quote = Cand gaurile negre sunt perturbate din starea de baza, ele emit vibratii care au frecvente si amortizare caracterizate de masa si spinul gaurii negre.

[quote4]

quote = Gaurile negre supermasive emit atata energie in unde gravitationale pe parcursul unui an cat o galaxie emite lumina pe parcursul intregii sale vieti.

[quote6]

quote = Emisiile de radiatie Gamma din afara galaxiei noastre (gamma-ray bursts) sunt feneomenele electromagnetice cele mai energetice din cuprinsul Universului, ele fiind posibil produse de coliziunea a doua stele neutronice sau a unei stele neutronice cu o gaura neagra .

[quote8]

quote = Observatoarele de unde gravitationale pot detecta un numar mare de semnale concomitente: semnale emise de gauri nergre duble care se ciocnesc, supernove, stele neutronice asimetrice, si altele.

[quote9]

quote = Cea mai buna modalitate de a observa Big Bang-ul ce a creeat Universul nostru este ascultand undele gravitational emise atunci. Acest ecou al noului Univers a calatorit spre noi aproape intact, fara a fi interactionat mult cu galaxiile.

[quote10]

quote = Ai stiut ca emisia de unde gravitationale este motivul pentru care perioada de rotatie a unui pulsar binar scade cu aproximativ 10 microsecunde in fiecare an?
weblink = http://www.astro.cf.ac.uk/research/gravity/tutorial/?page=3thehulsetaylor

[quote11]

quote = Ai stiut ca datorita emisiei de unde gravitationale in regim anizotropic, o gaura neagra care este formata din coliziunea a doua gauri negre va fi aruncata afara din galaxia in care se afla?
weblink = http://www.astro.cf.ac.uk/research/gravity/tutorial/?page=4blackholecollisions

[quote12]

quote = Ai stiut ca emisia de unde gravitationale din gauri negre este considerata un semnal standard - aceasta inseamna ca distanta pana la orice gaura neagra se poate determina cu acest semnal si astfel de surse sunt folosite pentru calcule cosmologice.

[quote13]

quote = Găurile negre binare pot o intr-o zi dezvălui secretul Energiei Negre (Dark Energy) - problema cea mai dificilă în cosmologiea de astăzi .

[quote14]

quote = Did you know that merging black holes were conceived to be a source of gravitational radiation by Freeman Dyson in 1960 - long before anyone thought of buidling a gravitational wave detector?

[quote15]

quote = Did you know that gravitational radiation, just as radio and other forms of electromagnetic radiation, are composed of just two polarizations only in a more complicated pattern?
weblink = http://www.astro.cf.ac.uk/research/gravity/tutorial/?page=2theeffect

[quote16]

quote = A black hole binary emits hundred times more energy in gravity waves in the last second of its life than a star of similar mass emits optical radiation in its entire life (100's of million to billions of years)!
weblink = http://www.astro.cf.ac.uk/research/gravity/tutorial/?page=4blackholecollisions

[quote17]

quote = Did you know that merging black holes approach each other at close to the speed of light?
weblink = http://www.astro.cf.ac.uk/research/gravity/tutorial/?page=4blackholecollisions

[quote18]

quote = In the final process of coalescence and merger, black holes lose 5% of their total mass to gravitational radiation. This makes them the most luminous objects in the sky!
weblink = http://www.astro.cf.ac.uk/research/gravity/tutorial/?page=4blackholecollisions

[quote19]

quote = The word black hole was coined by John Wheeler in 1967. Although black holes are invisible in the electromagnetic window they are the most luminous objects when seen in the gravitational window.
weblink = http://www.astro.cf.ac.uk/research/gravity/tutorial/?page=1blackholes

[quote20]

quote = Did you know that centre of Milky Way contains a 4 million solar mass black hole? Indeed, astronomers believe that every galaxy hosts a black hole of similar, or up to a thousand times more, mass.

[quote21]

quote = One of the biggest questions in Cosmology today is how did black holes that reside at galactic cores form. Gravitational-wave observations could provide the clue by directly observing their formation in the early Universe.
weblink = http://www.astro.cf.ac.uk/research/gravity/tutorial/?page=5super

[quote22]

quote = British mathematician Roger Penrose has conjectured that singularities - regions of intense gravity - are shrouded in horizons into which we cannot see. Gravitational observations could one day test his conjecture.

[quote23]

quote = Gravitational observations could test if the ultimate fate of all massive stars is really black holes or some other exotic compact star.
weblink =

[quote24]

quote = We know that White Dwarfs more massive than 1.4 solar mass (Chandrasekhar limit) collapse to form neutron stars. Gravitational wave observations should tell us the largest mass that a neutron star could have and its internal structure.
weblink = http://www.astro.cf.ac.uk/research/gravity/tutorial/?page=1blackholes

[quote25]

quote = If the mass of a neutron star is slowly increased would it collapse to a black hole or some other exotic form of matter? We don't know the answer to this question; gravitational-wave observations could provide the clue.

[quote26]

quote = What is the densest form of matter: neutrons? quarks? strange matter? Gravitational-wave observations could one day reveal.
weblink = http://www.astro.cf.ac.uk/research/gravity/tutorial/?page=1blackholes

[quote27]

quote = Are black holes really like fundamental particles characterized by only their mass and spin? LISA should answer by probing the spacetime geometry of a black hole.

[quote28]

quote = Binary black hole signals have been calculated by numerically solving Einstein's equations on supercomputers. These solutions make it possible to search for them using pattern matching techniques.
weblink = http://www.astro.cf.ac.uk/research/gravity/tutorial/?page=4blackholecollisions

[quote29]

quote = When a black hole binary merges, the resulting black hole would be imparted with a kick that is so large that it could escape from the host galaxy.

[quote30]

quote = An interferometric gravitational-wave detector can detect differential changes in its arm lenghts that is a thousand times smaller than the size of an atomic nucleus.
weblink = http://www.astro.cf.ac.uk/research/gravity/tutorial/?page=7advancedligo

[quote31]
quote = An interferometer detects gravitational waves by measuring the differential displacement (or strain) in its two arms. The strain sensitivity is so good that it is like measuring the difference in the distances to two nearest stars to within the width of human hair.

[quote32]

quote = After decades of effort physicists were successful in 2005 in solving Einstein's equations on a computer. The pretty images on black hole mergers are from those simulations.
